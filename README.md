# DC2126A
This repository contains applications for the [DC2126A](http://www.linear.com/solutions/5320) board.
* [On-chip SDK (OCSDK)] (https://github.com/dustcloud/onchipsdk) mote application code for the DC2126A
* [SmartMesh SDK (SMSDK)] (https://github.com/dustcloud/smartmeshsdk) python application to interact with the DC2126A in a network

## On-Chip SDK (tested with 1.1.0.8)
The 04-dc2126a sample consists of two folders that must be copied into the OCSDK:
* The IAR project file directory under /projects/iar should be copied into PATH_TO_OCSDK/projects/iar/
* The application source directory under /src/app should be copied into PATH_TO_OCSDK/src/app/

## SmartMesh SDK (tested with 1.0.8.142)
* The DC2126A directory should be copied into PATH_TO_SMSDK/app/

### DC2126A Python GUI Instructions
The DC2126A application receives and parses data from the DC2126A board, and allows you to vary the board's configuration parameters.
It can connect to:
* The SmartMesh IP Manager
* (Over the air) One or more DC2126A boards. This application is only useful if you have one or more DC2126A boards running in your SmartMesh IP network.

#### Running
You can run the DC2126A application by double-clicking on its source files at PATH_TO_SMSDK/app/DC2126A/DC2126A.py. 

#### Description
DC2126A is a GUI-based sample application. It connects to your SmartMesh IP Manager over a SerialMux or direct serial connection. If you have one or more DC2126A boards running in your SmartMesh IP network, it will automatically parse and display the data that each board gathers.
* Make sure your DC2126A board is running and is part of your SmartMesh IP network.
* Start the DC2126A sample application and connect it to your SmartMesh IP Manager. You can connect either over the SerialMux or serial port.
* When the DC2126A sample application connects to the SmartMesh IP Manager, it retrieves the motes in the network, and populates the **Select mote** drop-down menu.
* Each time the DC2126A board publishes data, that data is displayed in the upper-right hand corner of the DC2126A sample application.
* To see the data generated by a different DC2126A board in your SmartMesh IP network, select its MAC address using the **Select mote** drop-down menu.
* Clicking on the **get configuration** button sends a packet to the mote selected in the **Select mote** drop-down menu, requesting its current configuration. The mote answers with its current configuration, which is displayed in the configuration form.
* To modify the configuration of a particular mote: enter the report period, bridge settling time, and LDO on time, select mote's MAC address in the **Select mote** drop-down menu, and click **set configuration**.
* To update the MAC address, select the mote in the *Select mote* drop-down menu, and click on the **refresh** button.
